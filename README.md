# nesca-x64-executable
pre-built windows 64bit nesca executable with all the necessary dlls

not everybody knows how to build from source, so, i did compile it for the common people to enjoy

be warn, nesca is not one of the greatest achivements of the programming craft, it's REALLY rough around the edges and your time with it could highly depend on the system you're running it 

good luck!
